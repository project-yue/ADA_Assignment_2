Question 1
Usage:
1. dfs
command: "dfs nodeNumber", such as "dfs 0"

effect: DFS parenthesis form and highlight the DFS exploration in the graph

2. bfs
command: "bfs nodeNumber",such as "bfs 0"

effect: BFS parenthesis form and highlight the BFS exploration in the graph

3.isCycle
command: "cycle nodeNumber",such as "cycle 0"

effect:
if there is a cycle, highlight the cycle in the graph
otherwise, print "The graph is a DAG"

4.linearize
command: "linearize nodeNumber",such as "linearize 0"

effect:
if there is a cycle, print "The Graph has a cycle. It cannot be linearized!"
otherwise, print the linearization list.

5.scc
command: "scc nodeNumber",such as "scc 0"

effect:
print all the SCCs, and also highlight in the graph, the the vertexes and edges belonging to 
the same SCC use the same colour to highlight.

6.distance
command: "scc node1 node2",such as "distance 0 4"


effect:
if there is a path from node1 to node2, print the distance from node1 to node2, also highlight the shortest path from node1 to node2
otherwise, print "The distance from node 0 to node 4 is infinity."

7.isEulerian
command: "eulerian", such as "eulerian"
effect:
If the graph is eulerian, print the eulerian trail,and also highlight all the edges in the eulerian trail
otherwise,print "Eurian Trail does not exist!"

8.isBipartite
command: "bipartite", such as "bipartite"
effect:
the element in the two sets will be distinguished with red and blue colour. If there's an
edge connecting the same colour,print "The digraph is not bipartite!,otherwise, print
"Yes, the digraph is bipartite!".
